# Hello again!

It has been a year since I started this blog. To celebrate that, I am migrating the
web platform into NextJS. The reason why is mainly because I just want to learn
web development. This is also an opportunity to me to try vibe coding and I built
this website using help from Claude.

This website has still lots of issues, especially in mobile view (I don't think
it is actually functional LOL). I plan to tackle this step by step, and to add
small projects into this website too!
