## Hello!

I've been wanting to have my own website. So I started this blog.
This blog is made with [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/tree/master) theme for Jekyll, on top of [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

## Why?

I don't know, maybe I was just bored and wanted to type something on my keyboard.
Plus, I have a paid domain that I only use for hosting my Terraria games with my friends
a while ago (the gaming session only lasted for 2weeks), so I don't want to waste it.
Perhaps I can put things related to my side project here.
